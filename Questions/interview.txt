One dynamic programming , finding longest common subsequence
Kadane's algorithm, find largest common substring in an array of strings.

Discussion on projects, questions like reversing a linked list, sort an array of 0's, 1's and 2's in min time complexity, question on sorting a hashmap based on values and comparable interface in java , diff between Hashcode and equals methods and diving deep into that concept with some few examples.

Design an inventory of fruits, where you can check the stock, update the stock, and modify the price.

What is a predicate in Java? Can you throw an exception from a predicate?
Explain wildcard-extends and wildcard-super in Java.
Mirror image of tree
implement thread safe without synchronized keyword
	No need for synchronization at all if you don't have mutable state.
	No need for synchronization if the mutable state is confined to a single thread. This can be done by using local variables or java.lang.ThreadLocal.
	You can also use built-in synchronizers. java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock has the same functionality as the lock you access when using synchronized blocks and methods, and it is even more powerful.

mutable suggest anything that can change, i.e. an int

	int a = 0;
	System.out.prtinln(a); //prints 0
	a = 2;
	System.out.prtinln(a); //now prints 2, so its mutable
	In java a string is immutable. you cannot change the string value only its reference.

	String s1 = "Hello";
	System.out.println(s1); //prints Hello
	String s2 = s1;
	s1 = "Hi";
	System.out.println(s2); //prints "Hello" and not "Hi"
	State is something which an instance of a class will have (an Object).

If an Object has certain values for its attributes its in a diffrent state then another Object of the same class with diffrent attribute values

This round mainly consists of DSA questions
OOPs concept, Java Collections, Multithreading

Prepare DSA very well, it can turn your interview to an offer !
