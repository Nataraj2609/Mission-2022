Collection vs stream

String vs Sting Builder vs String buffer

map vs flatMap in stream

@Conditional in spring boot?

1. Shallow Copy Vs Deep Copy & Implementation
2. Co-varient Return Types
3. Collection
- For maintaining order in map -> LinkedHashMap
- Concurrent HashMap
- Problem where we need sort for custom object --> Override Equals And HashCode
4. try-with-resources with implementation
5. SOLID principles with example

# Java 8
- Parallel Stream & its pros and cons

# Spring Boot
- Profiling
- Saga Pattern for distributed transactions -- cache concept

# Microservices
- On Gateways, Discovery server ---> We use Eureka
- Hsytrix etc.. --> Fault tolerance

# Program
- Find Cube of number then filter total > 100 & then find its average
