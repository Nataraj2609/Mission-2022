Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.
[7,1,5,3,6,4]

int maxProfit = 0;


for(int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
	int prev = arr[i-1];


	if (arr[i] > prev)
        maxProfit += arr[i] - prev;
}

 return maxProfit;


 4 + 3 = 7 maxProfit



How serialisation works in java?
Does static members are serialized ? - No
how to make sure a member is not serialized - use Transient

Have to study on access specifier downgrading & upgrading stuffs

Find the odd number of occured element in an array
